<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Modular concept of the researchers’ toolkit _StudyToolkitVid_. From the formulated research question to the media editing to acquire test material, executing an online study and subsequently analysing the resulting data using statistical methods.

There are many ways to edit media and investigate human perception based on great implementations available online; however, we didn't find one that really suited our needs while investigating the importance of lip synchrony, so we created this toolkit. We wanted to create a toolkit so easy and intuitive to use that it'll enable less tech-savy people to explore their scientific itches. On the other hand we try to keep it as modular as possible to enable adjustments and partial use of it.

Our reasoning:
* Everyone loves freely available and easily accessible software.
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing while exploring different research questions and not get slowed down by rudimentary issues- trying to solve problems, already solved by others.
* You also shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over- especially by hand
  + Creating data sets for investigating perceived quality of video material
  + Setting up and executing a user study based on these (or other) data sets
  + Running and reporting a statistical analysis following the results from a study

Of course, no one toolkit will serve all projects since your needs may be different. While our focus is especially on the needs of investigating lip synchrony in video material, we will also try to add more diverse functionalities in the future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. We appreciate all contributions and want to thank everyone who helps out in any way possible!
